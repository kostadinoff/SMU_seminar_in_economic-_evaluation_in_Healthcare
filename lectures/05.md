# What is meant by cost?

1. Opportunity costs - The benefits forgone from the next best use of resources allocated to a particular use. 
2. Type of costs: 
- Direct costs vs Indirect costs 
- Healthcare costs vs Non-healthcare costs
3. Perspective: 
- Healthcare perspective: Costs that fall on the publicly funded healthcare system 
- Social perspective: We look at "all costs" regardless of whether they fall inside or outside of publicly funded healthcare budgets. 

# How costs can be measured?

1. Identify and measure resources used (activity) 
- Tools: Client Services Receipt Inventory (its worthy for mental health)
- costs/savings may "spill-over" 
2. Value the resources used in the activity.
- Identification of price weights also know as unit costs. 
- Resource use may be collected at trail sites and finance departments of those sites may offer one potential source for unit costs. 
- Tariffs may reference only what the payer is responsible for paying - not the full value of resource used 
- Tariffs may include discount 
- If we don't have national tariffs we can use "bottom-up approach"
# Inflantion and discounting
Discounting is how we adjust for time preferences. 

When we use info from other country we need to adjust for PPP purchasing power parity
