# EE
In summary. Usually we choice a social perspective 
step 1: Identifying costs and effects 
step 2: Measuring costs and effects 
step 3: Valuing costs and effects
step 4: Discounting
step 5: Ratio and CE plane
step 6: Uncertainty 

# Ratio
Its used only in CEA and CUA. For CBA and CMA ratio is not needed
C1-C2/E1-E2
C1- Costs of experimental program
C2 - Costs of convectional program 
# ICER
 We use lambda. Lambda is benchmark or willingness to pay for certain ICER. 
NOIR- interval and ratio are cardinal used in ratio. Nominal and ordinal are not 
Primary outcome goes in the ratio !

Ratio should be graphically presented in plane.
# Uncertainty analysis 
If the ICER is negative we are sure in our conclusion. Its either better or worse. 
However when the ICER is positive we need acceptance line - which usually is a threshold. 
There is a lot of uncertainty in our estimates. UA is what would have happened if we change our assumptions 

Types of uncertainty
1. Methodological      
2. Sampling variation 
3. Extrapolation
4. Generalisibility
