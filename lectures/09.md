# Biomarkers
Any characteristics that can be measured as indicator of state. 
- Prognostic biomarkers 
- Predicted biomarkers - can be target for therapy

# Companion Diagnostics 

- A device which is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding medicinal product to:
    1.  Identify, before and or during treatment, patients who are more likely to benefit from the corresponding medicinal product
    2. Identify, before and or during treatment, patients likely to be at increased risk for serious adverse reactions. 
    
- Precision medicine

# Emerging technologies and changing paradigms  

- N of 1 trial
- Real world data (because many patients are excluded of RCT) ==> Real world evidence 
- TAx - treatment agnostics 

# Genomic and other biomarker  

- Ethical issues 

# Clinical and economical evaluation challenges
