Costs - The value of inputs 
Price - costs and profit (surplus)

# Comparing health care systems
Transition model 
- Change the structure from inpatient to outpatient
- Bottlenecks in primary care and specialist visits lower demand for certain procedures and associated medical devices and/or pharmaceuticals 
- Excellence centers should be established 
- Increased expenditures 
- Concern about the quality of care 
- Shortage of nurses 

## Pressure for increasing expenditures
- Innovation (cost is not critical factor for success in the domain of health care)
- Increased wealth 
- More people with heath insurance
