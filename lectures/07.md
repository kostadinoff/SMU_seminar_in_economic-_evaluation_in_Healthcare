Costs - The value of inputs 
Price - costs and profit (surplus)

# Comparing health care systems
Transition model 
- Change the structure from inpatient to outpatient
- Bottlenecks in primary care and specialist visits lower demand for certain procedures and associated medical devices and/or pharmaceuticals 
- Excellence centers should be established 
- Increased expenditures 
- Concern about the quality of care 
- Shortage of nurses 


## Pressure for increasing expenditures
- Innovation (cost is not critical factor for success in the domain of health care)
- Increased wealth 
- More people with heath insurance

# Patient classification systems

1. Hospitals products: patients episodes of care (acute inpatients, non acute inpatients- long term, psychiatric, nursing homes); research, teaching, other services
2. History - Thomson and Fetter started the DRGs projects.
    - DRG were implemented in 1983 for MediCare patients 
    - in 80's Europe started to implemented the idea. In the beginning information collection was essential. The first projects was conducted in 1988. 
    - in the 90's results were ready. Slowly the PCS were adapted and spread across all countries 
3. Goal: Cost behavior of hospital 

The idea is to separate patients in groups with similar symptoms, needs and use of recourses. 
Case-mix is the bridge between clinical description and economical analysis. 
# Costs and prices
Building blocks
1. PPS (diagnosis, procedures, severity)
2. Data collection (clinical data, cost data, sample size)
3. Cost calculation (average costs, cost weights, grouping)
4. Reimbursement rate (base rate, outliers, hight cost cases)
