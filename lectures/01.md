# HTA and economic evaluation

HTA is more broad than EE. 
HTA Definition: The goal is to provide information. It is an multi-disciplinary, scientific based assessment og technologies in healthcare. It examines short and long term effects of the application. 

EE Definition: **Comparative analysis** between 2 ot more alternatives.In terms of costs (INPUT) and effects (OUTCOME). 4 main design CMA, CEA, CUA, CBA

# Terms:

HTA > EE > Cost effectiveness and cost benefit analysis 

## CMA
 We assume that effectiveness is the same and compare only costs. 

## CMA
 We measure the outcome in physical unit per unit of money 

## CUA 
 We measure the outcome in common unit called QUALY compare it to the costs 

## CBA 
We express the outcome and costs in money value. 

# Methods 
- Trail based approach 
pro: Limited costs, Unbiased, Effects and costs in the same population, Hight internal validity
cons: Time horizon, Failure to incorporate earlier evidence 

- Model based approach 
pro: can model over time
cons: Its be subjective 

## COSTS 
step 1: Identify

step 2: C = Q X P

## OUTCOMES
step 1: Survival * utilities 

step 2: EQ-5D instrument
